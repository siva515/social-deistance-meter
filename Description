in this video we are discussing about the  social distance meter 
the circuit board contains the Aurdio  UNO and IR sensor and one bread board and 12 LED circiut 
the circuit was conected as like that.
When ever the person comes near to us the burzzer emits the sound and the 12 leds glows as the person near to us.
i f the person is far from us only one led glows if the person is very near to us 12 led glows 
Here we had two functions 
loop and the distance 
the distance function is used to measure the  distance by taking input from the pin 6(Sensor) and it gives the signal to aurdino and there the distance is measured and the output is given to the leds.
